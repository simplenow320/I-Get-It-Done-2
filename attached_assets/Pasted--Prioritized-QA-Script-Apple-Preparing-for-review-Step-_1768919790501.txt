### P0 (Blockers) — Run these first (highest rejection risk)

#### Step 1 — **App is complete and ready (no known crashes/bugs)**
**Action:** Run the app end-to-end and confirm it’s complete and ready to publish; test on devices running the latest software; fix all bugs before submitting.  
**Pass criteria:** No crashes; no known bugs remaining; core flows work on latest OS.  
**Fail criteria:** Any crash, reproducible bug, or incomplete feature found.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screen recording of a full “happy path” session on a device running latest OS  
- Bug list showing “0 open critical/high issues” and/or crash logs if any occur

#### Step 2 — **No placeholder content**
**Action:** Inspect every screen and any downloadable/embedded content for placeholder images/text or “in progress” areas.  
**Pass criteria:** All images and text are finalized; nothing looks like a template or stub.  
**Fail criteria:** Any placeholder text (e.g., “lorem ipsum”, “coming soon”), temporary images, unfinished screens/flows.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screenshot set covering all main screens and key flows  
- A short screen recording scrolling through the UI to prove no placeholders

### P0 (Privacy/Data) — Common rejection triggers

#### Step 5 — **Privacy policy content check (must include required items)**
**Action:** Review your privacy policy text and confirm it includes all items Apple calls out.  
**Pass criteria:** Privacy policy:  
1) Identifies the data the app collects, how it collects it, and all uses of that data  
2) Confirms any third party receiving user data provides the same or equal protection as stated  
3) Explains data retention and deletion policies, including how users revoke consent and/or request deletion  
**Fail criteria:** Any of the above missing or unclear.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- URL to privacy policy and a PDF export/screenshot of the relevant sections (highlighted)  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 6 — **Permission prompts are clear about data use**
**Action:** Trigger every permission request (user or usage data access) and evaluate the user-facing explanation.  
**Pass criteria:** Permission request clearly and completely describes how the app will use the data (Apple notes an example can help users understand).  
**Fail criteria:** Vague purpose (e.g., “needed for app functionality”) or unclear benefit/usage.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screenshots of each permission prompt and the surrounding UI context explaining why it’s requested  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 7 — **Info.plist purpose strings exist for sensitive data APIs**
**Action:** Check the app’s Info.plist includes required purpose strings for APIs that access sensitive user data (Apple references the required user-facing purpose string key as `$!{infoPlistKey}`).  
**Pass criteria:** All required purpose strings exist and clearly explain why the app needs the data.  
**Fail criteria:** Missing purpose string(s) or unclear text.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screenshot or text excerpt of Info.plist entries showing purpose strings  
- Mapping table: “Sensitive API → purpose string present (Y/N)”

### P1 (Metadata + UX quality) — High impact, often checked

#### Step 8 — **Screenshots are accurate and device-matched**
**Action:** Review App Store screenshots for accuracy and device alignment.  
**Pass criteria:**  
- Screenshots accurately communicate value and functionality  
- Overlay text/images highlight UX, not obscure it  
- UI/product images match the corresponding device type in App Store Connect  
**Fail criteria:** Misleading screenshots, obscured UI, wrong device framing/type mismatch.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screenshot set as uploaded + App Store Connect device mapping proof (screenshots of the upload slots per device)

#### Step 9 — **UI quality: clean, refined, user-friendly**
**Action:** Heuristic review of UI for cleanliness/refinement/usability (Apple emphasizes this).  
**Pass criteria:** UI appears clean, refined, user-friendly across main flows.  
**Fail criteria:** Cluttered, confusing navigation, inconsistent layouts that reduce usability.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Screen recording walking through main flows  
- Screenshot montage of primary screens

#### Step 10 — **Not just a web wrapper / link collection**
**Action:** Determine whether the app is essentially web content in an iOS shell, unformatted web content, or mostly limited web interactions.  
**Pass criteria:** App is engaging/useful and “makes the most of features unique to iOS.”  
**Fail criteria:** App is primarily websites served in an iOS app, web content not formatted for iOS, or a collection of links/limited web interactions.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Short screen recording demonstrating native-feeling interactions and iOS-specific usage (as applicable)  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 11 — **Claims match reality (not misleading users)**
**Action:** Compare what the app appears to promise (in-app and in listing) to what it actually does.  
**Pass criteria:** App performs as advertised; promised features are present and working.  
**Fail criteria:** Any promised functionality missing, incomplete, or misleading.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- “Promise vs. Proof” evidence: screenshots of claims + screen recordings showing the feature works

### P2 (Portfolio / “value” considerations)

#### Step 12 — **Not a copycat**
**Action:** Evaluate whether the app is actively trying to copy another app.  
**Pass criteria:** App is an interesting, unique experience (not a copy).  
**Fail criteria:** Strong imitation of another app’s concept/branding/presentation.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Short written rationale describing what makes the app unique + screenshots of distinctive flows

#### Step 13 — **Not a set of essentially identical apps**
**Action:** If you have multiple apps, evaluate whether they are essentially the same.  
**Pass criteria:** Apps are meaningfully different, or thoughtfully combined into one where appropriate.  
**Fail criteria:** Several apps that are essentially the same.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- App lineup list + 1–2 sentence differentiation per app (or consolidation plan)  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 14 — **Enough lasting value**
**Action:** Assess whether functionality/content is substantial and not only useful to a tiny niche without enough depth.  
**Pass criteria:** App offers meaningful functionality/content and a strong user experience.  
**Fail criteria:** Minimal functionality/content or extremely limited usefulness that may lead to non-approval.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Feature list + screen recording of multiple distinct value moments

**Fail criteria:** Missing clearance documentation.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Copy of regulatory clearance + list of covered regions/locations  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 15C — **Third-party content/trademarks/copyright or streaming/downloading**
**Action:** If you use third-party trademarks/copyrighted content or allow streaming/downloading of third-party content, provide authorization.  
**Pass criteria:** Authorization is available and ready to provide.  
**Fail criteria:** No authorization.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Authorization documents + where they’re attached/provided for review  
[Source](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/)

#### Step 15D — **Services requiring licensing (gambling/lotteries/raffles/VPN licensing, etc.)**
**Action:** If the app facilitates services requiring licensing, provide authorization (and account for regional licensing differences).  
**Pass criteria:** Authorization exists for relevant regions.  
**Fail criteria:** Missing authorization.  
**Evidence to capture:**  
- Licensing/authorization docs + region coverage matrix

### Submission ops checks (helpful to avoid delays)

#### Step 16 — **Know where to manage submissions / messages**
**Action:** Confirm you can manage submissions and communicate with App Review on the App Review page within Apps in App Store Connect.  
**Pass criteria:** Team knows where to view messages/history and respond.  
**Fail criteria:** No process to monitor/respond to App Review.  
**Evidence to capture:**

## Output format your AI should produce (per step)
For each step, have the AI return:
- **Status:** PASS / FAIL  
- **Notes:** 1–3 sentences (what was checked, what was found)  
- **Evidence:** Links to recordings/screenshots/docs + where they live (folder/path)  
- **If FAIL:** Exact reproduction steps (for crashes/bugs/links/permissions)

If you tell me your app type (login required? what permissions? kids category? uses third-party content? webview-heavy?), I can mark which “Conditional” steps to enable and which to skip—without adding any requirements beyond Apple’s page.
