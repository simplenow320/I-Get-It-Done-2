AI review checklist (from Apple’s App Review prep page)
1) App Review Information (App Store Connect)
Check whether the app requires specific settings, user account info, or special instructions; if yes, ensure those details are included in the App Review Information section in App Store Connect. Source
If features require signing in, confirm a valid demo account username and password are provided. Source
If special configurations are required, confirm the specific configuration steps are provided. Source
If features are hard to replicate or require specific hardware, confirm you’re prepared to provide a demo video or the hardware. Source
Confirm contact information is complete and up to date. Source
Confirm the app is tested and submitted only when complete and ready to be published (Apple notes many issues fall under guideline 2.1 App Completeness). Source
2) Crashes and bugs
Check that the app is thoroughly tested on devices running the latest software. Source
Check that you have fixed all bugs before submission. Source
3) Broken links (required links)
Check that all links in the app are functional. Source
Check that there is a link to user support with up-to-date contact information. Source
Check that there is a link to your privacy policy (required for all apps). Source
4) Placeholder content
Check that all images and text are finalized (no placeholders). Source
Check the app does not contain “still in progress” placeholder content that indicates it’s not ready. Source
5) Privacy policy issues (what it must cover)
Check the privacy policy for all of the following:

It identifies the data the app collects, how it collects that data, and all uses of that data. Source
It confirms that any third party the app shares user data with provides the same or equal protection of user data as stated in your policy. Source
It explains data retention and deletion policies, and describes how a user can revoke consent and/or request deletion of their data. Source
6) Unclear data access requests (permissions + purpose strings)
Check that permission prompts clearly and completely describe how the app will use the data; Apple notes that including an example can help. Source
If your code references APIs that access sensitive user data, check that the app’s Info.plist contains the required purpose string key (shown on the page as $!{infoPlistKey}) with a user-facing explanation of why the data is needed. Source
Check that all required purpose strings are present for apps submitted to App Store Connect that access user data. Source
7) Inaccurate screenshots (App Store listing assets)
Check that screenshots accurately communicate value and functionality. Source
Check overlays/text are used to highlight the experience, not obscure it. Source
Check UI/product images match the corresponding device type in App Store Connect. Source
8) Substandard user interface
Check the UI is clean, refined, and user-friendly (Apple emphasizes planning design carefully and following their design guides). Source
9) Web clippings / content aggregators / collection of links
Check the app is engaging and useful and “makes the most of the features unique to iOS.” Source
Check it’s not just: websites served in an iOS app, web content not formatted for iOS, or limited web interactions (Apple says these don’t make a quality app). Source
10) Repeated submission of similar apps
Check you are not submitting several apps that are essentially the same; Apple recommends thoughtfully combining similar apps into one. Source
11) Copycats
Check the app is not trying to copy other apps; Apple advises focusing on unique experiences. Source
12) Misleading users
Check the app performs as advertised and does not give the impression it’s something it is not. Source
Check that if the app appears to promise features/functionality, it actually delivers them. Source
13) Not enough lasting value
Check the app offers enough functionality/content (Apple notes low functionality or very small niche applicability may lead to non-approval). Source
Check you’ve reviewed other apps in your category and considered how to provide a better user experience. Source
14) Submitted by incorrect entity
Check whether the app type requires submission by the legal entity that provides the services (Apple lists examples: banking/financial services, cryptocurrency, healthcare, gambling, air travel). Source
If partnership documentation/authorization is needed, check it’s attached in App Store Connect (Attachment section) and any descriptions/links are in Review Notes. Source
15) “Specific documentation required” scenarios (examples Apple lists)
Check whether your app matches any of these and ensure the noted documentation is ready/provided:

Kids category + third‑party ads: provide a link to the ad service’s publicly documented practices and policies for Kids apps, including human review of ad creatives for age appropriateness. Source
Medical hardware: provide a copy of regulatory clearance for the locations where the app is available. Source
Third-party trademarks/copyrighted content, or streaming/downloading third-party content: provide authorization to do so (Apple gives examples like video streaming and marketing imagery of celebrities/sports/movies/music). Source
Services requiring licensing (real money gaming/gambling, lotteries, raffles, VPN licensing): provide authorization (and note licensing varies by region). Source
16) Submission workflow / review status awareness (process checks)
Check you know you can manage submissions and communicate with App Review on the App Review page within Apps in App Store Connect. Source
Check whether your submission is for the App Store or Notarization only (EU-related flow referenced on the page). Source
Check review status in App Store Connect (or App Store Connect app); Apple notes if a submission is incomplete, review times may be delayed or it may not pass. Source
17) If rejected: what to do (from the page)
Check that you can view details (including specific guideline references) in App Store Connect and correspond with App Review to resolve issues before resubmitting. Source
If appealing: ensure you provide specific reasons you comply, submit only one appeal per submission, and respond to requests for info before submitting an appeal. Source
If requesting expedited review: ensure the request matches Apple’s listed extenuating circumstances and includes the required details (critical bug reproduction steps; or event/date/association). Source
