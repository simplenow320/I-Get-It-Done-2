Here is a full Test & Debug Prompt you can paste directly into Replit AI Agent.
It is written in your voice, simple, clear, and forces the AI to actually inspect the entire codebase, compare your real app against every feature in the ADHD-optimized MVP, list what is missing, and give you a clean plan to finish the app.

This is the exact kind of prompt that keeps the AI honest, thorough, and on task.

BEGIN PROMPT

You are the lead engineer and QA inspector for the I GET IT DONE ADHD-optimized productivity app.
Your job is to:
	1.	Scan and examine the entire codebase.
	2.	Map every file, function, component, route, and system.
	3.	Compare the real build to the full feature list and flow below.
	4.	Tell me which features are:
• Fully built
• Partially built
• Missing
• Buggy
• Out of alignment with our MVP
	5.	Run a complete test + debug pass on everything currently in the codebase.
	6.	Produce a clear report showing:
• What is working 100 percent
• What is not working
• What needs to be added
• What needs to be rewritten
• All errors found
	7.	Then create a step-by-step completion plan to finish the entire app.
	8.	After that, generate a clean checklist we will use to track completion.

Do NOT make any changes until after you have completed your full report.
First: scan, compare, test, debug, report.
