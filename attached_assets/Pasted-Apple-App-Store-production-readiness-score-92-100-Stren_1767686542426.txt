Apple App Store production readiness score: 92/100

Strengths: account deletion flow with password verification is implemented in both client UI and server API, satisfying Apple 5.1.1(v). (client/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx; server/routes.ts)

Broad feature coverage and prior audit show compliance and stability across security, device handling, and UX. (AUDIT_REPORT.md; replit.md)

Remaining gap to 100%: manual production checks and device-level verification still outstanding. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Replit-ready to-do list to reach 100%
Validate App Store assets and metadata

Confirm icon, screenshots, description, privacy URL, and support URL are final and reachable. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Lock in production environment secrets

Double-check DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, and SESSION_SECRET in Replit secrets. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt; package.json scripts rely on these)

End-to-end push notification test on devices

Send test notifications on physical iOS/Android; verify permission prompts and payload content. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Voice capture verification

On iOS/Android, run the Quick Dump voice flow and ensure microphone permission copy is appropriate; confirm web shows fallback. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Team/delegation QA

Generate and redeem invites, delegate tasks, and walk statuses through pending → accepted → completed. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Legal page availability

Open Terms and Privacy endpoints from the live server build to ensure uptime and content accuracy. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt; server/templates/privacy.html)

Fresh install & core journey smoke tests

On real devices: register → onboard → create tasks across all four lanes → Break It Down → Focus timer → Weekly Reset → delete account. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)

Stripe production dry run

Run through checkout and customer portal flows with test cards in production mode; verify publishable key exposure route works. (server/routes.ts: /api/stripe/publishable-key)

Performance/foreground-background sanity

Check offline behavior, background/foreground resume, and memory usage on at least one older device. (MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED.txt)
