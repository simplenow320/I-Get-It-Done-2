I GET IT DONE – ADHD-Optimized MVP

Purpose of the App

I GET IT DONE helps people with ADHD stay focused, start tasks, finish tasks, and avoid overwhelm. It removes the stress of long lists and uses simple time windows to make work feel doable.

The app is built on how ADHD brains actually work: fast, intuitive, idea-heavy, easily overloaded, and motivated by small wins, structure, and clear feedback.

⸻

ADHD Problems This App Solves

Research and clinical insights show that ADHD challenges often include:

• Time blindness
• Task initiation trouble
• Overwhelm from big tasks
• Difficulty estimating effort
• Losing track of priorities
• Forgetting what you planned
• Low dopamine when tasks feel boring
• Needing accountability or visual cues

This MVP directly targets each of these challenges with features that support real ADHD needs.

⸻

Core Concept

Every task is sorted into a simple lane:

Now
Soon
Later
Park

Simple words. Zero confusion. ADHD brains respond better to clear, concrete categories instead of complex systems.

Users choose the time windows so the app matches their pace.

⸻

THE FOUR LANES (EXPLAINED FOR ADHD USERS)

Now

Tasks that must be done today.
Purpose for ADHD: Reduces overwhelm by giving the user a short list of high-impact actions. Keeps them from bouncing across 20 things.

User can choose:
• Same day
• 24 hours

⸻

Soon

Important tasks that belong in the next few days.
Purpose for ADHD: Gives the brain a short horizon without sudden pressure. Prevents the “everything is due now” panic.

User chooses:
• 2–3 days
• End of week
• Custom window

⸻

Later

Tasks for future weeks that still matter.
Purpose for ADHD: Keeps tasks from feeling forgotten while removing clutter from today’s mental space.

User chooses:
• Next week
• Two weeks
• Custom time frame

⸻

Park

Not needed right now. Set it aside.
Purpose for ADHD: Supports idea-heavy brains without drowning them. Park becomes a safe holding zone.

User chooses reminder style:
• Monthly
• Quarterly
• Manual review only

⸻

ADHD-Crucial Features (Fully Integrated)

Here is the full feature set, with the purpose and neuropsychology behind each.

⸻

1. Smart Task Sorter

User enters a task → selects Now, Soon, Later, or Park.
The app applies their time windows automatically.

ADHD Purpose:
Reduces decision fatigue by letting users pick a lane fast. Eliminates the demands of “what date should this be due?” which ADHD brains struggle with.

⸻

2. Quick Capture / Brain Dump

A big button on the dashboard: Quick Dump

User can:
• Type rapid-fire tasks
• Speak tasks into the mic
• Paste a list from somewhere else

All tasks land in an “Unsure” box. Later, the app guides the user—one by one—through choosing a lane.

ADHD Purpose:
ADHD brains generate ideas fast. If capture is slow, the idea is gone. This protects working memory and reduces anxiety.

⸻

3. Task Chunking (‘Break It Down For Me’)

Every task has a button:

Break It Down

The app automatically generates small steps such as:
• Open the document
• Write the intro
• Outline section one

User can edit or add their own steps.

Tasks display a progress bar as steps are completed.

ADHD Purpose:
ADHD brains freeze when tasks feel too big. Small steps lower the activation energy and increase dopamine each time they complete a chunk.

This is one of the most important ADHD features.

⸻

4. Focus Timer (Sprint Mode)

Each Now task includes a built-in timer with preset options:

• 10 minutes
• 15 minutes
• 25 minutes
• Custom

A visual countdown ring keeps the brain anchored in time.

When the timer finishes, the app says:

“You did it. Want another sprint?”

ADHD Purpose:
Counters time blindness.
Boosts task initiation.
Keeps users from drifting.
Gives dopamine from small wins.

This transforms your “Now” list into actual action.

⸻

5. Auto-Move System

Tasks slide between lanes automatically:

• Soon → Now when its window hits
• Later → Soon when the next week arrives
• Park → Only moves if user chooses to revisit
• Overdue tasks move to Now and get flagged gently

ADHD Purpose:
ADHD brains forget to check old tasks or reschedule. Auto-move prevents failure loops and reduces shame.

⸻

6. Multiple Reminder Types

Each task can have several reminder styles:

• Soft nudge
• Strong alert
• Persistent reminders
• Daily summaries
• Lock screen Now count

Users can tune reminders to their attention style.

ADHD Purpose:
ADHD brains often miss single reminders. Having customizable, layered options increases follow-through without feeling annoying.

⸻

7. Daily Focus Mode

Shows only Now tasks.

Features:
• One task at a time if the user prefers
• Swipe to complete
• Swipe to move to Soon
• Launch focus timer directly
• Visual progress ring for the day

ADHD Purpose:
Removes distraction and choices. Supports hyperfocus in the right direction.

⸻

8. Weekly Reset

Once a week, the app runs a reset:

Shows:
• Wins (dopamine booster)
• Tasks that auto-moved
• Park items untouched
• Suggestions for cleanup
• Optional future planning

ADHD Purpose:
ADHD brains thrive with built-in structure and feedback loops.
Weekly reset prevents chaos from building up over time.

⸻

9. Light Gamification

Not childish. Just enough dopamine.

Features:
• “Days you cleared Now” streak
• Points for completing chunks
• Level badges
• Confetti or glow on task completion

ADHD Purpose:
Helps sustain motivation when interest fades.
Gives micro-rewards to keep the brain engaged.

⸻

10. Delegation (Hand-Off Mode)

User adds people during onboarding.

Hand-off flow:
• Open task
• Tap “Hand-off”
• Choose a person
• Send a task card

App tracks progress and reminders.

ADHD Purpose:
Reduces overwhelm by allowing users to remove tasks from their mental load and still maintain visibility.

⸻

11. Accountability Option (Future Feature)

Optional mode:

• Invite a partner to see your Now list for the day
• Tap a button to start a focus session together
• Check-ins for sprint sessions

ADHD Purpose:
Body doubling is proven to increase task initiation.
Helps users maintain momentum.

⸻
