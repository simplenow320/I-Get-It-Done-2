I GET IT DONE – MVP DOCUMENT

App Purpose

I GET IT DONE helps people finish what matters today by sorting tasks into four simple lanes: Now, Soon, Later, Park.
The app removes overwhelm, keeps the list short, and builds a rhythm of daily action.

This MVP focuses on fast input, smart sorting, automatic timing, and clear follow-through.

⸻

Core Problem

Most people get stuck because they treat every task like it’s urgent. This leads to long lists, lost priorities, and low follow-through.

I GET IT DONE solves that with a simple question:
“When do you want to handle this?”

⸻

Core Concept

Every task in life falls into one of four lanes:

Now
Do it today.

Soon
Do it in the next few days.

Later
Do it in the next few weeks.

Park
Set it aside until it’s useful.

Users define how fast each lane moves so the app matches their pace.

⸻

Main Features

1. Onboarding Setup

Fast and simple.

User sets default timing for each lane:

• Now → Same day or 24 hours
• Soon → 2–3 days, end of week, or custom
• Later → 1 week, 2 weeks, or custom
• Park → Monthly check, quarterly check, or manual only

User chooses:

• Solo mode
• Or Team mode (for handing off tasks)

Onboarding ends with a clean dashboard.

⸻

2. Add Task + Smart Sorter

User taps Add Task
Enters a title (and optional note)

App asks one question:
“When do you want to handle this?”

User taps:
Now / Soon / Later / Park

The app automatically gives the task a due window based on their chosen defaults.

⸻

3. Auto-Move System

Tasks shift forward automatically.

Examples

• A Soon task becomes Now when its time window hits.
• A Later task becomes Soon when the next week arrives.
• Park stays where it is until user checks or the reminder hits.

This keeps the list fresh without manual updates.

⸻

4. Dashboard (Home Screen)

Four bold buttons:

Now

Shows today’s tasks only. Clean. Short. Actionable.

Soon

Tasks coming up based on settings.

Later

Future tasks that still matter but don’t crowd today.

Park

Ideas, low priority tasks, and “not right now” items.

User taps any lane to view or adjust tasks inside.

⸻

5. Daily Focus Mode

When the user taps Now, they see a simple list.

Features:
• One-tap complete
• Swipe to add notes
• Button to push task to Soon or Later

Clean, fast, no overwhelm.

⸻

6. Hand-Off (Optional)

If a user adds team members, they can assign tasks.

Flow:
	1.	Open a task
	2.	Tap Hand-off
	3.	Choose a person
	4.	Add a quick note
	5.	Hit send

The other person gets:
• A task card
• Due window
• Notes
• Status updates

The app tracks completion for the user.

⸻

7. Weekly Reset

Once a week the app shows a simple review:

• What you completed
• What moved from Later to Soon
• What moved from Soon to Now
• What’s stuck in Park
• Suggested clean-up

This helps the user reset and stay sharp.

⸻

App Flow (Step-by-Step)

5. View “Later”

6. Check “Park”

7. Weekly Reset

8. Optional Delegation

User assigns tasks to others and gets progress updates.

⸻

Use Cases

1. Busy Leader

A pastor or business owner has 20 things on their mind.
Instead of juggling everything, they drop each item into a lane:

• Write message → Now
• Meet with volunteer → Soon
• Plan retreat → Later
• New outreach idea → Park

Their day instantly becomes clear.

⸻

2. Parent with Heavy Schedule

Parent sorts tasks while sitting in the car:

• Pay field trip fee → Now
• Order groceries → Soon
• Research summer camps → Later
• Idea for birthday → Park

No chaos. No forgetting.

⸻

3. Student

A college student uses the lanes:

• Assignment due today → Now
• Prep study group → Soon
• Register next semester → Later
• Explore internship options → Park

Their semester stays organized.

⸻

4. Solo Entrepreneur

A business owner uses the defaults:

Now = Today
Soon = This week
Later = Next week

Tasks flow automatically.
No more clutter or stress.

⸻
